About
==============
Hello. This is the readme for Michael Keith's release of Duncan Lorimer's
SIGPROC.

SIGPROC is a pulsar search processing software: See the documentation at
http://sigproc.sf.net/

Compilation
==============
To compile from the source distribution, you need GNU autotools. If you
don't have autotools, or it doesn't work for you, you will need to obtain
a distribution version of sigproc. This can be downloaded and installed 
through psrsoft (http://www.pulsarastronomy.net/wiki/Software/PSRSoft)
or by emailing mkeith@pulsarastronomy.net to get an up-to-date tarball.

./bootstrap
./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
make
make install

The GNU automake system accepts many "standard" variables for controling
how your system is detected, including the following very useful variables...

If you need to set your compilers (e.g. if you have gfortran and g77 installed)
set the following variables prior to ./configure (e.g. for gcc and gfortran) 

e.g.
FC=gfortran
F77=gfortran
CC=gcc
CXX=g++

If you have strange compile-time options that need to be set (e.g. for PGPLOT)
set the following variables prior to ./configure

e.g.
CFLAGS=-I/pgplot/include/path
CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS
LDFLAGS=-L/pgplot/lib/path

If you need special fortran compiler flags...

e.g.
FFFLAGS=-ffixed-line-length-none
