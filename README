About
==============
Hello. This is the readme for Michael Keith's release of Duncan Lorimer's
SIGPROC.

SIGPROC is a pulsar search processing software: See the documentation at
http://sigproc.sf.net/

This software is based on "psrsoft" at the following URL: 
http://www.pulsarastronomy.net/wiki/Software/PSRSoft


Prerequisites
==============
To compile from the source distribution, you need the following tools on a modern *buntu system (Ubuntu, Xubuntu, etc.):
* csh                  C-shell peer of bash and sh
* autoconf             automatic configure script builder
* automake             Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
* libcfitsio-dev       library for I/O with FITS format data files (development files)
* libgsl-dev           GNU Scientific Library (GSL) -- development package
* libtool              Generic library support script

They can be installed with the standard ```apt`` utility, assuming one has ```sudo``` privileges.


Compilation and Installation
============================
./bootstrap
./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
make
make install

The GNU automake system accepts many "standard" variables for controling
how your system is detected, including the following very useful variables...

If you need to set your compilers (e.g. if you have gfortran and g77 installed)
set the following variables prior to ./configure (e.g. for gcc and gfortran) 

e.g.
FC=gfortran
F77=gfortran
CC=gcc
CXX=g++

If you have strange compile-time options that need to be set (e.g. for PGPLOT)
set the following variables prior to ./configure

e.g.
CFLAGS=-I/pgplot/include/path
CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS
LDFLAGS=-L/pgplot/lib/path

If you need special fortran compiler flags...

e.g.
FFFLAGS=-ffixed-line-length-none
